<h3>I'm Wesley Abbey! I'm a developer currently living in Boston.</h3>

<p>On the weekends I run across rooftops as Batman. However, when I'm not fighting crime I'm usually
programming at Wayfair or doing a handstand.</p>

<p>You can find me on <a href="https://twitter.com/{{site.twitter_username}}">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/wesleyabbey.io/">Instagram</a>, <a href="https://github.com/wesleyabbey">Github</a>, and on <a href="http://www.wesleyabbey.com">here!</a></p>

<p>I'm currently a software engineer at Wayfair. Previously I was an associate consultant as Infusion and a software developer intern at Siteworx.</p>

<p>I graduated from UNC Chapel Hill with a Computer Science degree although I grew up in San Diego. I still haven't found anything on the east coast that can match a California Burrito...</p>
