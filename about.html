<h3>I'm Wesley Abbey! I'm a developer currently living in Boston.</h3>

<p>On the weekends I run across rooftops as Batman. However, when I'm not fighting crime I'm usually programming at Wayfair or doing a handstand.</p>
 
<p>You can find me on <a href="https://twitter.com/{{site.twitter_username}}">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/wesleyabbey.io/">Instagram</a>, <a href="https://github.com/wesleyabbey">Github</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/wesleyabbey">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/Wesley-Abbey">Quora</a>, and on <a href="http://www.wesleyabbey.com">here!</a></p>
 
<p>I'm currently a Software Engineer at Wayfair. Previously I was an Associate Consultant at Infusion and a Software Developer at Siteworx.</p>
 
<p>I graduated from UNC Chapel Hill with a Computer Science degree and I grew up in San Diego, California. I still haven't found anything on the east coast that can match a good California Burrito.</p>
